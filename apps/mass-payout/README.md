# Mass Payout Application

## Status: Placeholder

This workspace is currently a placeholder for the future mass payout web application. It has been created as part of the monorepo structure to reserve the workspace namespace and ensure proper workspace configuration.

## Future Development

This application will contain:

-   Web interface for mass payout operations
-   User dashboard for payment management
-   Integration with mass payout package components
-   Administrative tools for batch processing

## Current Structure

```
apps/mass-payout/
├── package.json    # Basic workspace configuration
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Development

Currently, this workspace contains only placeholder scripts. All commands will output placeholder messages:

```bash
npm run build   # Placeholder build command
npm run test    # Placeholder test command
npm run dev     # Placeholder dev command
npm run start   # Placeholder start command
```

## Technology Stack

When implemented, this application will likely use:

-   React with TypeScript
-   Vite for build tooling
-   Integration with the mass payout package
-   Hedera SDK integration

This workspace is not yet ready for development. Please refer to the main project documentation for contribution guidelines.
