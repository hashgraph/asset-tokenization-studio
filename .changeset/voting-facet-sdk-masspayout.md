Migrated all voting operations in the SDK from `Equity__factory` to the new `VotingFacet__factory`, aligning with the contract refactor that split voting logic into a dedicated `VotingFacet`. Updated mass-payout contracts to import `IVoting` for voting structs/methods and `ICoupon` for coupon holders, and updated the backend adapter and tests to use `CouponToken` instead of `BondToken` for `getAllCoupons` and `getTotalCouponHolders`.
