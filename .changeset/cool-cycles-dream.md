Increase test coverage for smart contracts by adding comprehensive tests for ERC standards (ERC1410, ERC20, ERC3643, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes), factory components, bond and equity modules, clearing, access control, external lists, KPIs, and other functionalities. Includes fixes for test synchronization, removal of unused code, and optimization of test fixtures.
