# ClearingLifecycleOps

_Asset Tokenization Studio Team_

> ClearingLifecycleOps - Lifecycle path for cleared deferred operations

Library that owns the post-creation phase of the clearing protocol: approve, cancel, reclaim, and the dispatcher that routes each action through the appropriate execution helper (transfer, redeem, hold creation), along with the ABAF-aware balance restoration and allowance restoration helpers.

_Extracted from `ClearingOps` to keep both libraries below the EIP-170 24 KiB runtime cap. The creation entry points and event emitters stay in `ClearingOps`; this library reuses `ClearingOps.beforeClearingOperation` via an `internal` call, which the compiler inlines so no cross-library link is required at deploy time._

## Errors

### AbafChangeForBlockForbidden

```solidity
error AbafChangeForBlockForbidden(uint256 blockNumber)
```

Raised when attempting to change ABAF for a block that is forbidden

#### Parameters

| Name        | Type    | Description                        |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| blockNumber | uint256 | The block number that is forbidden |

### InvalidPartition

```solidity
error InvalidPartition(address account, bytes32 partition)
```

Thrown when an account does not hold or is not associated with the specified partition.

#### Parameters

| Name      | Type    | Description                                   |
| --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| account   | address | Address that was checked.                     |
| partition | bytes32 | Partition that was not found for the account. |

### SnapshotIdDoesNotExists

```solidity
error SnapshotIdDoesNotExists(uint256 snapshotId)
```

Thrown when the requested snapshot identifier has never been taken on this token.

#### Parameters

| Name       | Type    | Description                                             |
