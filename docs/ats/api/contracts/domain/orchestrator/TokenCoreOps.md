# TokenCoreOps

> TokenCoreOps - Orchestrator for core token operations

Deployed once as a separate contract. Facets call via DELEGATECALL.

_Contains balance operations for ClearingOps to avoid inlining._

## Methods

function checkCompliance(address _from, address _to, bool _checkSender) external view
```

#### Parameters

| ------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| \_from        | address | undefined   |
| \_to          | address | undefined   |

## Events

### Approval

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
```

Emitted when `owner` authorises `spender` to spend up to `value` tokens on their behalf, whether via {IAllowance.approve}, {IAllowance.increaseAllowance} or {IAllowance.decreaseAllowance}.

_Mirrors the ERC-20 `Approval` event. `value` is the resulting, absolute allowance after the update — not the delta applied._

| owner `indexed`   | address | Address whose tokens may be spent.                                 |
| spender `indexed` | address | Address authorised to spend on `owner`&#39;s behalf.               |
| value             | uint256 | Allowance of `spender` over `owner`&#39;s tokens after the update. |

### DelegateVotesChanged

```solidity
event DelegateVotesChanged(address indexed delegate, uint256 previousBalance, uint256 newBalance)
