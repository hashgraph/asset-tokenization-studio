# ClearingOps

_Asset Tokenization Studio Team_

> ClearingOps - Orchestrator for clearing creation operations

Library that owns the creation phase of the clearing protocol: deferred transfers, redeems, and hold creations; per-partition allowance bookkeeping; ABAF (Accumulative Balance Adjustment Factor) synchronisation; and emission of the cleared-creation events. The post-creation lifecycle (approve, cancel, reclaim, dispatch, balance restoration) lives in the sibling `ClearingLifecycleOps` library.

_Deployed once as a separate contract. Facets call via DELEGATECALL. All functions mutate state through StorageWrappers and emit clearing- specific events. Cleared funds are held in a separate balance ledger until the clearing operation is resolved. ABAF adjustments are applied atomically before any operation execution to ensure balance integrity. Extracted from a single monolithic library to keep deployed bytecode below the EIP-170 24 KiB runtime cap._
