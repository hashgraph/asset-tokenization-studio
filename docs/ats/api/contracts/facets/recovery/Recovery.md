# Recovery

_Asset Tokenization Studio Team_

> Recovery

Abstract contract implementing lost-wallet recovery logic.

_Delegates storage reads and writes to {ERC3643StorageWrapper}. Inherits all access-control and partition-validation modifiers from {Modifiers}._

## Methods

### initializeRecovery

```solidity
function initializeRecovery() external nonpayable
```

Initialises the recovery capability on the token.

_Callable once; subsequent calls revert with `FacetAlreadyRegistered`. Requires `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Called by the factory during deployment._

### isAddressRecovered

```solidity
function isAddressRecovered(address _wallet) external view returns (bool)
```

Returns whether a wallet address has been marked as recovered.

#### Parameters

| Name     | Type    | Description       |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| \_wallet | address | Address to query. |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description                                                              |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \_0  | bool | True if the address has previously been recovered via {recoveryAddress}. |

### recoveryAddress

```solidity
function recoveryAddress(address _lostWallet, address _newWallet, address _investorOnchainID) external nonpayable returns (bool success_)
```

Transfers the token balance and frozen amounts of a lost wallet to a new wallet, marking the lost wallet as recovered.

_Caller must hold `ROLE_AGENT`. The lost wallet must not have already been recovered, must carry no pending locks, holds, or clearings, and the token must be single-partition. Emits {RecoverySuccess} on success._

#### Parameters

| Name                | Type    | Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_lostWallet        | address | Address of the wallet that was lost.                              |
| \_newWallet         | address | Address of the replacement wallet that will receive the balances. |
| \_investorOnchainID | address | On-chain identity address of the investor (may be zero address).  |

#### Returns

| Name      | Type | Description                                      |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| success\_ | bool | `true` when the recovery completes successfully. |
