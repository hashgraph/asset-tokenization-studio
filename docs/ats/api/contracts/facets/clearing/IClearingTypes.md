# IClearingTypes

_Asset Tokenization Studio Team_

> IClearingTypes

Defines all shared types — enums, structs, events, and errors — for the clearing mechanism of the Asset Tokenization Studio.

_Clearing is a settlement layer that places token operations (transfers, redeems, and hold creations) in a pending state before final execution. A designated operator may then approve, cancel, or reclaim each pending operation within its expiration window. This interface is inherited by every facet that participates in the clearing flow so that a single, consistent set of types and events is emitted across the diamond._

## Events

### ClearingIsActivated

```solidity
error ClearingIsActivated()

Thrown when a clearing-dependent operation is attempted while the clearing feature is disabled on the token.

### ExpirationDateNotReached

```solidity
error ExpirationDateNotReached()

Thrown when an action requires the clearing operation to have expired (e.g., a reclaim attempt) but the expiration timestamp has not yet passed.

### ExpirationDateReached

```solidity
error ExpirationDateReached()
```

Thrown when an action requires the clearing operation to still be within its validity window but its expiration timestamp has already passed.

### InvalidClearingAmount

```solidity
error InvalidClearingAmount()
```

Thrown when the token amount supplied for a clearing operation is invalid (e.g., zero or exceeding the holder&#39;s available balance).

### WrongClearingId

```solidity
error WrongClearingId()
```

Thrown when the supplied `clearingId` does not correspond to an existing or active clearing operation for the given holder and partition.
