# ILockTypes

_Asset Tokenization Studio Team_

> ILockTypes

Lock domain events and errors shared across the Lock facets.

_Holds the `LockedByPartition` and `LockByPartitionReleased` events (emitted from both `Lock` and `LockByPartition`) and the `LockExpirationNotReached` / `WrongLockId` errors (reverted from modifiers and `LockStorageWrapper`, which both facets use). Both `ILock` and `ILockByPartition` inherit from this interface. Structs that are I/O of external methods on a single facet (e.g. `LockData`) live in that facet&#39;s interface instead._

## Events

### LockByPartitionReleased

```solidity
event LockByPartitionReleased(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder, bytes32 indexed partition, uint256 lockId)
```

Emitted when a previously created lock is released back to its token holder.

_Emitted by `release`, `releaseByPartition` and `forceReleaseByPartition`. The released amount is not part of the event because the underlying lock entry is removed atomically; consumers can correlate with the prior `LockedByPartition` via `(partition, tokenHolder, lockId)`._

#### Parameters

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| operator `indexed`    | address | The caller that requested the release.             |
| tokenHolder `indexed` | address | The address the tokens are returned to.            |
| partition `indexed`   | bytes32 | The partition the lock was held on.                |
| lockId                | uint256 | The identifier of the lock that has been released. |

### LockExpirationUpdated

```solidity
event LockExpirationUpdated(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder, bytes32 indexed partition, uint256 lockId, uint256 oldExpirationTimestamp, uint256 newExpirationTimestamp)
```

Emitted when a lock&#39;s expiration timestamp is updated by a locker.

_Emitted by both `updateLockExpiration` (default partition) and `updateLockExpirationByPartition` (any partition)._

#### Parameters

| Name                   | Type    | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| operator `indexed`     | address | The caller that requested the update (must hold `ROLE_LOCKER`). |
| tokenHolder `indexed`  | address | The address whose lock expiration is being updated.             |
| partition `indexed`    | bytes32 | The partition the lock lives on.                                |
| lockId                 | uint256 | The identifier of the lock being updated.                       |
| oldExpirationTimestamp | uint256 | The expiration timestamp before the update.                     |
| newExpirationTimestamp | uint256 | The new expiration timestamp after the update.                  |

### LockedByPartition

```solidity
event LockedByPartition(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder, bytes32 indexed partition, uint256 lockId, uint256 amount, uint256 expirationTimestamp)
```

Emitted when an amount of tokens is locked on a specific partition until an expiration timestamp.

_Emitted by both `lock` (default partition) and `lockByPartition` (any partition) so consumers can monitor every lock creation through a single topic._

#### Parameters

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| operator `indexed`    | address | The caller that requested the lock (typically holds `ROLE_LOCKER`).     |
| tokenHolder `indexed` | address | The address whose tokens are locked.                                    |
| partition `indexed`   | bytes32 | The partition the tokens are locked on.                                 |
| lockId                | uint256 | The identifier assigned to the new lock for `(partition, tokenHolder)`. |
| amount                | uint256 | The amount of tokens locked.                                            |
| expirationTimestamp   | uint256 | The Unix timestamp at which the lock becomes releasable.                |

## Errors

### InvalidLockAmount

```solidity
error InvalidLockAmount()
```

Reverts when a lock creation is attempted with a zero amount.

_Checked at the start of `LockStorageWrapper.lockByPartition`, which is the single entry point shared by both `Lock.lock` and `LockByPartition.lockByPartition`._

### LockExpirationNotReached

```solidity
error LockExpirationNotReached()
```

Reverts when a release is attempted before the lock&#39;s expiration timestamp.

_Used by the `onlyWithLockedExpirationTimestamp` modifier and by `LockStorageWrapper.checkLockedExpirationTimestamp`._

### WrongLockId

```solidity
error WrongLockId()
```

Reverts when a lock identifier does not exist for the given `(partition, tokenHolder)` pair.

_Used by the `onlyWithValidLockId` modifier and by `LockStorageWrapper.checkValidLockId`._
