> IFreezeTypes

Freeze domain events shared across the freeze facets.

_Holds the `TokensFrozen`, `TokensUnfrozen` and `AddressFrozen` events, emitted from both `Freeze` (single operations) and `BatchFreeze` (batch operations), so consumers can monitor every freeze change through a single topic. `IFreeze` inherits this interface; `BatchFreeze` imports it directly to reach the events without depending on the full `IFreeze` API._

## Events

### AddressFrozen

```solidity
event AddressFrozen(address indexed userAddress, bool indexed isFrozen, address indexed owner)
```

Emitted when a wallet&#39;s address-level frozen status changes.

#### Parameters

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| userAddress `indexed` | address | The wallet address whose freeze status was updated.                 |
| isFrozen `indexed`    | bool    | The new freeze status; `true` means frozen, `false` means unfrozen. |
| owner `indexed`       | address | Address of the agent who triggered the status change.               |

### TokensFrozen

```solidity
event TokensFrozen(address indexed account, uint256 amount, bytes32 partition)
```

Emitted when a specific amount of tokens is frozen for a wallet.

#### Parameters

| account `indexed` | address | The wallet address whose tokens were frozen. |
| amount            | uint256 | The amount of tokens frozen.                 |
| partition         | bytes32 | The partition from which tokens were frozen. |

### TokensUnfrozen

```solidity
event TokensUnfrozen(address indexed account, uint256 amount, bytes32 partition)
```

Emitted when a specific amount of previously frozen tokens is unfrozen for a wallet.

#### Parameters

| Name              | Type    | Description                                    |
