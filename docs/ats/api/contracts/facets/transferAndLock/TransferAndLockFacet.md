# TransferAndLockFacet

_Asset Tokenization Studio Team_

> TransferAndLockFacet

Diamond facet that wires the TransferAndLock capability to its resolver key.

_Extends `TransferAndLockFacetBase` with the concrete resolver key and initialiser key bindings. All selector and interface registration is handled by the base contract._

### getStaticInterfaceIds

```solidity
function getStaticInterfaceIds() external pure returns (bytes4[])
```

Gets all interfaces ids of a facet.
