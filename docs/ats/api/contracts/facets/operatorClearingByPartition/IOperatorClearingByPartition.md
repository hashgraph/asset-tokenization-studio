# IOperatorClearingByPartition

> IOperatorClearingByPartition

Interface for operator-initiated clearing operations: redeem and transfer by partition.

## Methods

### initializeOperatorClearingByPartition

```solidity
function initializeOperatorClearingByPartition() external nonpayable
```

Initialises the operator-clearing-by-partition capability on the token.

_Callable once; subsequent calls revert with `FacetAlreadyRegistered`. Requires `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Called by the factory during deployment._

_Fires exclusively from `initializeOperatorClearingByPartition`._

## Errors

### ClearingIsActivated

```solidity
error ClearingIsActivated()
```

Thrown when an administration action requires clearing to be inactive but it is currently enabled.

### ClearingIsDisabled

```solidity
error ClearingIsDisabled()
```

Thrown when a clearing-dependent operation is attempted while the clearing feature is disabled on the token.

### ExpirationDateNotReached

```solidity
error ExpirationDateNotReached()
```

Thrown when an action requires the clearing operation to have expired (e.g., a reclaim attempt) but the expiration timestamp has not yet passed.

### ExpirationDateReached

```solidity
error ExpirationDateReached()
```

Thrown when an action requires the clearing operation to still be within its validity window but its expiration timestamp has already passed.

### InvalidClearingAmount

```solidity
error InvalidClearingAmount()
```

Thrown when the token amount supplied for a clearing operation is invalid (e.g., zero or exceeding the holder&#39;s available balance).

### WrongClearingId

```solidity
error WrongClearingId()
```

Thrown when the supplied `clearingId` does not correspond to an existing or active clearing operation for the given holder and partition.
