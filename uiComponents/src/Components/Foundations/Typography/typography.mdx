# Typography

## How to set up

By default, typography configuration use the following structure: [Type][Variant][Size] (e.g.: ElementsBoldSM)
If, due to project requirements, it is necessary to use a different configuration, it is essential to instantiate the new "textStyles" in the "theme.ts" file.

```tsx dark
const theme = {
  textStyles: textStyleConfig,
};
```

## Heading

This text style will be used in page titles, table titles, section titles...

<Story of={TypographyStory.Headings} />
<br />

## Body Text

This text style will be used when there are long text fields. For example descriptions, instructions, etc.

<Story of={TypographyStory.Texts} />
<br />

## Element

These styles are used for texts that are inside components and therefore are not considered "Body Text" as such. In our case, these are the majority of texts.

<Story of={TypographyStory.Elements} />
