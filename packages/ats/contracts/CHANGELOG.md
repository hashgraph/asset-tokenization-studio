## 1.15.3

### Patch Changes

- Initial setup of Changesets for version management

    This changeset establishes the baseline for the new version management system using Changesets. All ATS packages are now aligned to version 1.15.2 and will be managed together using fixed versioning.

    Mass-payout packages will continue to be versioned independently.
