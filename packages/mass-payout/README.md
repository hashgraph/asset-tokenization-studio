# Mass Payout Package

## Status: Placeholder

This workspace is currently a placeholder for future mass payout functionality. It has been created as part of the monorepo structure to reserve the workspace namespace and ensure proper workspace configuration.

## Future Development

This package will contain:

- Core mass payout business logic
- Smart contracts for batch payment processing
- SDK components for mass payout operations
- Utilities and helpers for payment distribution

## Current Structure

```
packages/mass-payout/
├── package.json    # Basic workspace configuration
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Development

Currently, this workspace contains only placeholder scripts. All commands will output placeholder messages:

```bash
npm run build   # Placeholder build command
npm run test    # Placeholder test command
npm run dev     # Placeholder dev command
```

## Contributing

This workspace is not yet ready for development. Please refer to the main project documentation for contribution guidelines.
